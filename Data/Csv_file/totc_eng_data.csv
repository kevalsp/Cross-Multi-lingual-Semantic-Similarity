I beg continued Mr. Lorry moderéis which your agitation.,3
Here it is not only business.,4
"As I was saying...
But the look of the young woman broke down in such a way that it stammering, continued:
As I was saying ... If Mr. Manette had not died, and if instead of dying, had disappeared mysteriously silent; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place was gone; Had it not been any compatriot so scary that would be dangerous to speak softly even your father, that is, without running the risk of being locked up forever more in some forgotten prison; if his wife had implored the king himself, queen, court and even the same ecclesiastical authorities to give him news of the missing, but always in vain ... then the story of your father would have been the same as that unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.",4
"-¡Continuad, sir, I beg you!",3
"I'm going to continue, but do not you lack courage?",3
Anything is preferable to the uncertainty that have left me.,4
"You speak calmly and surely, you are already quiet.",3
"So I like added,
although his attitude seemed less pleased than their words.- This is only a business ... a business to be carried out.",4
"However; If the doctor's wife, though a lady of great value and very courageous, suffered much from this cause before her son was born ...
'It was a child, sir, but a girl.",4
"Well, a girl.",4
This does not alter the business.,4
"So Miss, the poor lady suffered so much before birth her daughter, who was resolved save the legacy of pain she had suffered, and made him believe that his father had died.",4
"Do not, do not kneel!",4
Why do you kneel?,3
-For beg you to tell me the truth.,2
"Oh, sir, bemoan me and tell me the truth!",3
-and I will ... but this is nothing more than a business.,4
I do aturrulláis and I can not follow.,4
"If, for example, I say how much added nine times ninepence or shillings there in twenty guineas, you will leave me calmer.",4
"Without answering this question, she made an effort to control himself, and warning him his interlocutor, he exclaimed:
Well, well.",4
Good courage.,3
This is only a business and good business.,4
"Miss Manette, your mother took the decision I have indicated, and when he died, heartbroken with grief, and without leaving a moment to make inquiries regarding your father left you at two years of age on the way to grow beautiful, happy and penalties, and free from the dark cloud that would have represented to you the uncertainty of not knowing if your father was still locked in a dungeon and still suffering the tortures of being buried alive.",4
"He looked sympathetic to the golden-haired young, as if he had feared them some silver threads.",4
-and you know that your parents had no great fortune he added that they possessed was properly insured for your mother and you yourself.,4
"No new discoveries made money, but ...
He stopped worthless to continue and after slight pause he added:
But he, however, has been found.",4
Lives.,0
"Very changed, probably, and become a ruin, but we have hopes of something better.",4
It is essential that lives.,4
"Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and there are going to target.",4
"I identify you, if I may; and you to return to life, love, duty, rest and well-being.",4
"She shivered, then quietly said,
-¡Voy to see its spectrum!",4
"It will be their spectrum, but not him!",4
"Mr. Lorry stroked the hands of the young man and said:
Calm yourself, Miss.",4
Now you know everything good and everything bad.,4
"Come on
to meet the unfortunate knight, and after a happy journey by sea and land, you will find at his side.",4
"The young, in the same tone of voice, exclaimed:
'I've been happy and have enjoyed freedom and has never haunted me his ghost.",4
"'I must tell you something else pursued Mr. Lorry, trying to fix the attention of
When the young man.- had found another name for his or someone forgot or had interest to remain ignored.",4
"No need to try now to find out, nor is there reason to investigate why for so many years he was imprisoned, and because they forget him or because they wanted to have it locked up until his

death.",4
These inquiries would be dangerous.,4
"It is better not to talk about any of that, at least while we are in France.",4
"I myself, although I am a British subject and used to Tellson Bank, with all the importance that France has the house, I avoid talking about it and not take it with me and a role which it relates.",4
"All powers that accredit me to resolve this issue, understood only one word: ""Risen"", which means nothing.",4
But what is that?,0
"Poor thing, I do not even hear.",4
Senorita Manette!,4
"She was motionless and silent, senseless, with eyes open and fixed on him, as if he were a statue.",4
"The gentleman did not dare to touch, afraid to hurt her, but was quick to scream for help.",4
"A woman appeared in untamed appearance and Mr. Lorry observed that was red from head to foot, as red was her hat, her hair red and her face red and her dress.",4
"He ran into the room, preceding the servants of the inn and without thinking much shoved the knight, sending him to the nearest wall.",4
'That is not a woman!,4
He thought Mr. Lorry.,4
- more like a man.,4
'What do you stand looking?,4
She cried the woman going to the maids.,4
- Why do not you go in search of the necessary quedaros instead of looking at me like that?,4
"Bring me then salt, water and vinegar go!",3
"And as you added, turning to Mr. Lorry: - podíais tell you not all that without frightening her?",4
Look how you left!,3
Pale as death and meaningless!,4
Is that what you call being a banker?,4
"Mr. Lorry had no answer and humbly stood by the wall, hardly daring to look, and the woman took the remedies that had brought the servants, then ordering them to leave if they did not want to tell them something unpleasant.",4
I hope soon regain the sense observed Mr. Lorry.,4
-Not for what you have done woman.- said the mine Poor thing!,4
"He said Mr. Lorry hope after another pause and with the same humility
that you will accompany Miss Manette in his trip to France.",4
-¡Sois a fool!,4
"cried the woman.- Do you think that if Providence had
I had arranged to travel by sea, I would have given birth on an island?",4
"And this was difficult to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry's retired to meditate.",4
"Chapter V. The Tavern
A large wine barrels fell on the street and broke.",4
"It happened the accident to
download of a carriage; He rolled a barrel and tripping over the ground was released fences and wine spilled, while the staves were facing a tavern, as huge broken walnut.",4
How many people there had suspended their work or laziness to go to drink wine poured.,4
"Irregular and outgoing stones of the street, intended, apparently, to maim those who would approach them, were the cause of several small ponds, each of whom I was surrounded by some individuals who, kneeling and were formed the hollow of his hand, the liquid collected and drank.",4
"Others gathered with crocks and even soaking handkerchiefs women wore head to twist them then even on the open mouths of children, and those who could not catch the precious liquid entertained licking staves covered inside stool.",4
"And thus was the desire of everyone so that,
While the wine lasted there was the greatest joy in the street, but once was not a drop ceased, as if by magic, the jubilation.",4
"All returned to

their occupations and cadaverous faces to come out of the dark caves disappeared back into them.",4
"As the wine was spilled red, he stained the floor of the narrow street in the neighborhood of San Antonio, Paris.",4
"There was also stained many hands and many faces, and those who entertained licking staves were with red spots around the mouth, like gorged Tigers meat, and there was even a joker with fingers dipped in red mud, wrote on the wall the word ""Blood"".",4
Day would come when this wine was poured out on the streets and whose red stain also many of those who were there.,4
"Street again returned to his usual state, it left a moment, and was sad, cold, dirty, full of disease and misery, ignorance and hunger.",4
"Everywhere aged poor, weak and hungry individuals were seen.",4
The children were old faces and spoke gravely.,4
Hunger reigned in the neighborhood as mistress and warned its manifestations everywhere.,4
"The streets were narrow and winding, not to mention dirty as middens and houses that were made were inhabited by people steeped in the blackest misery.",3
"But even after all, there were plenty bright eyes, pursed lips and wrinkled foreheads.",4
"In the same stores also it warned the general necessity, because only in butcher shops and meat scraps in small bakeries and breads looked rude.",4
Concurrent to taverns drank their tiny glasses of wine or beer and spoke confidentially.,4
"Nothing was there represented in flourishing state, except for the armories and stores that were selling tools.",4
"Instruments or steel weapons were brilliant, they were sharp and plentiful.",3
Street uneven floor was lacking sidewalks and bumpy.,4
"Lanterns, at long intervals, hanging from ropes that crossed from one side to another street and evenings just enough to dispel the shadows.",4
They were sharp and plentiful.,3
Street uneven floor was lacking sidewalks and bumpy.,4
"Lanterns, at long intervals, hanging from ropes that crossed from one side to another street and evenings just enough to dispel the shadows.",4
They were sharp and plentiful.,3
Street uneven floor was lacking sidewalks and bumpy.,4
"Lanterns, at long intervals, hanging from ropes that crossed from one side to another street and evenings just enough to dispel the shadows.",4
The tavern before which broke barrel in the corner of the street and looked better than other establishments.,4
"The publican watched the fight spilled drink wine without importársele much, because as the mess was caused by unloading the wine, ran their own provide another barrel.",4
"Suddenly his eyes surprised the prankster who wrote on the wall with his fingers and angrily approached him, wiping his hands the terrible word that the other trace.",4
"The publican was a man of martial appearance, bull neck and thirties.",4
"It must be fiery temperament, because even though the day was very cold wore slung shoulder jacket and shirt sleeves rolled to the elbow.",4
The head was covered only by her black curly hair.,4
"Otherwise it was dark, had good eyes and determined look.",4
"He seemed in good humor, but ruthlessness, resolute and strong-willed.",4
"Madame Defarge, his wife, was sitting in the tent, behind the counter, when it came.",4
"She was a big woman, the same age as her husband, with watchful eyes that seemed to look at anything, big hands, adorned with rings, face strong features and expression of perfect composure.",4
"He seemed very wedges and was wrapped in furs, including the head, although revealing earrings.",4
"She had before her knitting-work, but had put aside to clean his teeth with a splinter.",3
"So busy Madame Defarge said nothing when entering her husband, but merely coughed slightly, and this coupled with a slight movement of his eyebrows, said her husband watch the convenience of its customers,
Indeed, the publican soon discovered a gentleman of some age, accompanied by a young lady who sat in a corner.",4
"Other customers were

there playing, and while the bartender went behind the counter noted that the gentleman said referring to him:
This is our man.",4
"Telling herself she did not know, the barkeep stopped to talk to the three patrons who were drinking at the counter.",4
"How's it going, Jaime?",4
He asked one tabernero.- do you already have drunk all the wine poured?,4
"Until the last drop, Jaime said Mr. Defarge.",4
"As they had done sharing his name, Madame Defarge coughed again and raised his eyebrows again.",4
"-few times observed the second of three, Mr. Defarge- addressing these beasts have a chance to taste the taste of wine or anything else but black bread and death.",4
"Not so, Jaime?",4
"You're right, Jaime said Mr. Defarge.",4
"After this second exchange of name, Madame Defarge coughed again and again raised his eyebrows.",4
"The last of the three left the empty glass and wiped his lips, saying:
Those poor animals have always in the mouth another very bitter taste and a very hard life, Jaime.",4
Did not I say okay?,4
"You're right, Jaime said Mr. Defarge.",4
"At that time, after the third exchange name, Madame Defarge put the toothpicks, raised his eyebrows and shifted in his seat.",4
It's true he murmured his marido.- Gentlemen ... my wife.,4
"The three parishioners were discovered at Madame Defarge and bowed, to which she replied, bowing his head and examining them quickly.",4
Then he looked indifferently toward the tavern and resumed her knitting-work.,4
Gentlemen said her husband had watched with great attention: -The furnished room you wished to see is on the fifth floor.,3
"The staircase of the patio, left ... But now I remember that one of you already knows and can guide others.",4
"Good bye, sirs.",4
"They paid the wine they had drunk and went, and while the publican watched his wife some old gentleman advanced from his corner and expressed desire to speak alone with the barkeep.",4
"With great pleasure, sir, 'said Defarge him toward the door.",4
The conference was very short but decisive effects.,4
Almost at the first word the publican was startled and said the most attention.,4
It was not after one minute when he made an affirmative signal and went out.,4
Then the gentleman called the young man with hand and both went well.,4
Madame Defarge knitting and still saw nothing.,4
Mr. Jarvis Lorry and the Miss Manette came and reached the tavern and the barkeep at the ladder which he sent three parishioners.,4
In the dark staircase entrance black the publican dropped to one knee and took his lips the hand of the daughter of his former master.,4
"It was a delicacy, but made so that there was nothing delicate.",4
"In a few seconds he suffered a great transformation, because his face was no longer any expression of good humor and frankness, but reserve cholera and dangerous man.",4
He's quite tall Mr. Lorry said dryly.,4
-He is alone?,0
he murmured.,4
Who want to be with him?,4
said the barkeep.,4
-¿Está always alone?,0
-Yes.,0
'Why your desire?,4
-for your need.,4
"As it was when I saw him and asked if I wanted him
in my house.",4
So it is now.,4
I -¿Está really changed?,4
I -¡Cambiado!,4
"The publican slammed his fist into the wall and uttered blasphemy, which was more
Mr. Lorry eloquent a clear answer.",4
"Penoso would climb the stairs of an old house in Paris in our time, but
then it was even more.",4
"In each of the landings there was a lot of trash deposited by neighbors, and that mass decaying vitiate the atmosphere so you could barely breathe.",4
Mr. Lorry had to stop twice with a windows fitted bars giving exit to mefítico environment; But finally they reached the top and the publican who went before them took a key from his pocket.,4
-¿Está locked up?,1
Asked Mr. Lorry.,4
Yes Defarge said dryly.,3
'Do you think I need to have so reclusive that poor gentleman?,4
-Considero require keys to unlock.,2
-Why?,0
"Because he lived so shut up time, which shy away from death if this door is left open.",4
-It's possible?,4
-So is.,0
"Such dialogue took place so quietly that not a word reached the ears of
the young woman who was trembling with emotion and his face expressed such terror that Mr. Lorry felt it necessary to guide you some words to give encouragement.",4
"-¡Valor, dear lady, courage!",3
The worst will be over in a moment.,4
Once we passed this door.,3
Then start all the good that you bring you and all that you offer to the unfortunate.,4
Our good friend Defarge help us.,4
Come on.,3
Rounding one of the turns of the stairs they found three men who were at a door and looking through the keyhole.,4
Upon hearing the footsteps of those who went turned their heads and proved to be the three parishioners of the same name who had been drinking at the tavern.,4
I forgot them in the surprise of your visit said Mr. Defarge.,4
"- Leave us, friends.",4
We have to do.,4
The three undertook the descent and disappeared.,4
"There was already another door and was about to open publican, when Mr. Lorry asked:
'Have you made to Mr. Manette display object?",4
"Let'm seeing, as have observed, but only a few are chosen.",4
'Do you think it's okay?,4
-Yes I believe it.,4
Who are those few?,4
How do you choose?,3
"-Escojo those who are true men and are called like me, Jaime.",4
"For other
part you are English and not would understand me.",4
"then he looked through a hole in the wall and lifting the head, called two or three
Sometimes at the door, with no other apparent purpose than making noise.",4
With the same intention noisily he puts the key in the lock and finally opened.,4
Before entering he said something and answered a weak voice from inside.,4
"Then he motioned to the barkeep

his companions to enter and Mr. Lorry took the girl's arm, as he observed that he lacked strength.",4
Come in with me -dijo.- All this is nothing more than ... a matter of business.,4
"I'm scared, 'she replied shaking.",4
-Of what?,0
I mean it.,4
Of my father.,3
"Embarrassed by the state of the young and the signs that made him the barkeep, Mr. Lorry rose to his companion in arms and pulled her into the room.",4
"Defarge took the key, locked inside, all that with as much noise as he could, and eventually walked slowly up to the window beside which he stopped.",4
"The place obviously aimed at woodshed, was very dark, as there was a window on the roof only and was half closed.",4
"It was therefore difficult to advance to the prevailing low light, but there though and back to the door, I was a white-haired man sitting on a low stool, very busily making shoes.",4
"Chapter VI The Shoemaker
Good morning said Mr. Defarge looking at the white-haired man who had his head bent over her work.",4
"The challenged looked up and softly, as distant, answered the salutation:
-Good Morning.",3
"Always working, huh?",4
"After long silence, the white head rose again and said:
-Yes I'm working.",4
"And this time, before tilting back his head, the old man looked at tabernero
with her deranged eyes.",4
The weakness of the voice caused compassion and fear of time.,4
"It was not weakness
resulting from the loss of strength, but undoubtedly was due largely to the closure and lack of use.",4
It was as faint echo of a very old sound.,4
"There was a pause and then the barkeep said:
I wish to open a window slightly to let more light.",4
Will you be able to resist?,3
"The shoemaker stopped his work and asked:
-What are you saying?",4
That if you can withstand a little more light.,4
I'll have to resist if you let go.,3
"The publican opened the window and the light beam which entered the old shoemaker left to see
that his lap half-finished shoe.",4
On the sidewalk and on the floor were his tools.,4
"His white beard, badly cut, the sucking face and eyes very bright.",4
"His shirt open chest, exposing his white and sagging skin.",4
"And both he and the rags he wore, because of the long confinement had acquired yellowing parchment.",4
He put a hand to his eyes to protect them from light and then saw that it was transparentaban bones.,4
"He not is looking at the barkeep, but just ran my eyes to either side, as if he had lost the habit of associating the space with sound.",4
-¿Vais end today this pair of shoes?,4
Defarge said while motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.,4
-What are you saying?,4
If you are going to finish today this pair of shoes.,4
This question reminded him of his work again and bent over her.,4
"While
advanced both Mr. Lorry carrying hand to the young, and when to thing

one minute that were next to Defarge, the shoemaker looked up.",4
"He showed no signs of surprise at seeing someone else, but her hand to his lips and then resumed work.",4
-Tenéis a visit Defarge 'I said.,4
-What are you saying?,4
Which is a visit.,4
"Look, this gentleman is very intelligent footwear.",4
"show him
the shoe you are doing.",4
"Take a Lorry he said giving the zapato.- Now added, turning to the shoemaker 'Tell this gentleman what kind of shoe is it and name it does.",4
"There was a long pause and then the poor man said:
I've already forgotten what you said to me.",4
I repetídmelo.,4
'Can you describe this shoe?,2
It's a lady's shoe.,4
"A fashion, though I've never seen fashion.",4
'And the name of the shoemaker?,4
-¿Preguntáis you my name?,4
he said after a long silence.,4
-Precisely.,0
One hundred and five North Tower.,4
-Nothing else?,0
One hundred and five North Tower.,4
And with a sigh again absorbed in his work.,4
-¿Sois shoemaker by trade?,3
He asked Mr. Lorry.,4
"The challenged she stared at Defarge, like inviting him to answer, but given that
he did not, he did say:
No, it's not my job.",4
I have learned here.,4
I learned by myself.,4
I asked permission ... He paused as if not resolved to continue and then added: -Pedí permission to learn myself.,4
"I got it at the end, after many
difficulties and since then I make shoes.",4
"And while the hand held out waiting for them to return his work, Mr. Lorry
He asked, staring at him:
You isn't you remember me, Mr. Manette?",4
"The shoe fell, while the poor shoemaker who asked him looked at.",4
"Isn't not you remember this man, Mr. Manette?",4
"He asked Mr. Lorry,
He is putting his hand on the arm of Defarge.",4
-Miradlo well.,4
Look at me too.,4
"Do not return to your memory the images of those who were your former banker and your servant, and you remember your old business, Mr. Manette?",4
"Captive many years stared at Mr. Lorry and Defarge let your eyes show some flashes of the old intelligence, but were soon clouded.",4
"And that happened again when the unfortunate eyes fixed on the beautiful face of the girl, sliding along the wall progressed holding out his hands, in his desire to shake his head against his chest that spectrum.",4
But again it was off the flash of intelligence.,4
"Sighing, the shoemaker resumed its work.",4
"I -¿Lo have recognized, sir?",4
Defarge asked softly.,0
"Yes, for a moment.",4
"At first I did not believe it possible, but then, for a moment, I have fully recognized the face that was so familiar to me.",4
But let us withdraw a little.,4
"Young, meanwhile, had moved closer to his father and stood beside him in
While he was absorbed in his work.",4
"Finally, I had need to change tools and in doing so his eyes fixed on the end of the skirt of her daughter.",4
Then he looked up and saw his face.,4
"The two men were startled, fearing that the bastard could hurt her with his knife, but she waved them to remain still and they obeyed.",4
"He stared at her, startled, and looked as if his lips would articulate some words, but remained silent.",4
"Then, after a few moments when his breathing was gasping with emotion he felt, he said:
-What is this?",4
"She took his hands to his lips, and then folded his arms across his chest, as if he's dear old man's head support.",4
Isn't're the jailer's daughter?,4
he asked.,4
"No, 'said the young woman with a sigh.",4
"Who are you, then?",4
"Not daring to answer, she sat on the bench beside his father,
which she recoiled, but she laid her hand on his arm.",4
"Strange commotion over him, and leaving aside the blade stared at the apparition.",4
"The golden-haired young, hair in long ringlets, fell on her slender neck and the old man, advancing slowly hand, gently touched the golden strands, but the light for a moment just shine in his intelligence was extinguished, and giving sighing, he sails out to sea again in their work.",4
But not for long.,2
"She put her hand on his shoulder and, after doubting that, indeed, the appearance was real, put aside the work, hand to neck and pulled out a blackened cord from which hung an old cloth bag.",4
"He opened it with the utmost care, above the knee, and then saw that it contained some hair; only two or three golden strands, which on more than one occasion surround his fingers.",4
"He took back the hair of young and murmured:
-How is it possible?",4
They are the same.,4
When it happened?,4
How?,0
On his forehead concentration he warned his ideas.,4
"Suddenly he took the head of the girl, returned to the light and looked at most
Attention.",4
"That night when I called, she rested her head on my shoulder ...",4
"I had
afraid to come out, but I did not fear anything ... and when I locked him in the North Tower, I found it hidden in his sleeve.",4
Would I let you keep it?,4
"You can not help facilitate the escape of my body, but allow my spirit to leave.",4
"I said these words, I remember.",4
perfectly.,0
"These words formed on his lips several times before pronouncing power, but when he did he issued a coherent way, albeit slowly.",4
-How can that be?,4
Vos you were?,0
"Again viewers were alarmed that scene, because he had turned to the girl with extraordinary rapidity.",4
"But the girl sat quietly and softly said to them,
I beg, gentlemen, that you approach not and will not soon shaken even.",3
What voice is this?,3
He exclaimed the old man.,4
"As he uttered these words released her white hair is mesó, but
reassuring then kept his bag, but still looking young.",4
"No, no, 'he said,' You are too young and pretty.",4
Can not be.,4
"See how is the
prisoner.",3
"These are not the hands she knew, the voice that was used to hearing.",4
No no.,4
"She was, and he also ... before the last long years in the North Tower ... ago that was a long, long time.",4
"What is your name, my angel?",4
"The young man dropped to his knees before his father, with hands folded over his chest.",4
"Oh, sir, I know what my name, and you shall know who were my mother and father and their sad, sad story.",4
But now I can not tell you.,4
What I do ask now is that touch me with your hands and bless me.,3
"Kiss me, Kiss me.",4
"White old man's head made contact with the golden hair of the girl, who seemed to lend new life, as if about it shine the light of freedom.",4
"If you hear my voice, and maybe it well, but I hope, if you hear in my voice any resemblance to that once was sweet harmony in your ears, weep, weep for her.",3
"If my hair touching something reminds you of an adored one day He rested his head in your chest when you were young and free, weep, weep for her.",4
"If when you name the home that awaits us, and which I will strive to happy to make you with my love and care, I remind you a home that was devastated while your poor heart missed him, weep, too weep for him .",4
"And the old man around the neck with his arms, rocked him on his chest, as if he were a child.",4
"If I tell you, my dear, you've already finished your agony and I've come to take me to England, to enjoy peace and tranquility, and that makes you remember that your life miscarried when so useful it could have been and that your country, France, was so cruel to you, too weep, weep.",4
"And if when I tell you my name and my father, who still lives, and my mother, who died already know that I will have to fall on his knees before my dear father to apologize for having left to seek their freedom and not crying for him night and day, because the love of my poor mother away from me this torture, also weep for it, weep for me and for her.",4
"Good gentlemen, thank God, because I feel that his tears run down my face and sobs shaking over my heart.",3
Behold!,1
"Thank you,
The poor old man had taken refuge in the arms of the young and rested her head on his chest.",4
And that scene was so touching that the two witnesses covered their faces with their hands.,4
"When quiet reigned again in that dark place, the two men approached to raise the father and daughter, then, imperceptibly, had slipped to the ground ..
If it were possible that the girl said, unmolested, it could have all to leave Paris as soon as possible ...
'Do you think it will be able to endure the journey?",4
He asked Mr. Lorry.,4
-more than continuing in this city so fatal for him.,4
"It's true, 'said Defarge who had knelt to hear and see mejor.- More than
to stay.",4
Mr. Manette will always be better off away from France.,4
Do you want to go to hire a carriage and post-horses?,4
A business that is already answered Mr. Lorry recovering at once his methodical ways - and whether to terminate a business is better than me handle it.,4
Do Then please leave us alone Manette.- begged Miss You see what has remained quiet; Do not be afraid to leave me alone with him.,4
"Shut the door behind you, so do not interrupt us, and, no doubt, you will find it easy to return.",4
"Unwise looked at the two men this proposition, and at least one of them wanted to stay, but as also had to arrange the necessary paperwork and time pressed, the necessary steps were distributed and rushed out.",4
"While accentuating the shadows, she stood beside his father, still looking at him.",4
Both stood still and finally a ray of light filtered through a hole in the wall.,4
"Mr. Lorry and Defarge had prepared everything for the trip and took him, plus some warm clothes, bread, meat, wine and hot coffee.",4
Defarge stopped on the sidewalk provisions shoemaker and the lamp he carried and helped by Mr. Lorry lifted the captive.,4
"Nobody would have been able to tell by the expression on his face, the mysterious ideas of his mind.",4
It was impossible to understand whether he realized what had happened and the fact that it was free.,4
